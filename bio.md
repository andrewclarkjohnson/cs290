My name is Andy Johnson.
I live in Japan.
I'm married with 3 children and a puppy.
When I was younger I did lots of hiking. Now work and family life take up most of my time.
Winters are long when we live so we do lots of sledding, skiing and snowboarding. We also play lots of board games and cards (in order to keep the kids from being addicted to iPads).
I'm an associate professor at a Japanese university teaching Communication.
