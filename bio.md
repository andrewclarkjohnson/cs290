My name is Andy Johnson.
I live in Japan.
I'm married with 3 children and a puppy.
When I was younger I did lots of hiking. Now work and family life take up most of my time.
Winters are long when we live so we do lots of sledding, skiing and snowboarding. We also play lots of board games and cards (in order to keep the kids from being addicted to iPads).

Programming Background
I first started mucking around with programming in high school back in the 80s. That was with Basic and Fortran.
In the early/mid 2000s, I started playing around with HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL to make some fun, dynamic pages full of security holes.
Now that I'm in this CS program, I've learned C and C++.
